This is a virtual share market game made by me as a fun little project fully made in python! 😀

I found many paper trading simulators on Android and iOS but never seemed to find one for Windows. 😔

So I decided to make one! 😬

This game is still under development but when it's complete, it'll be epic! 😃

In this game, there is no connection to any real world. The prices are what the players make it! It may go up, it may go down, who knows? 🤔

This is an exciting project, and I wanna take it way further in the future! 🙂‍↕️

(Note: currently, the server is an HTTPS website but if ever I make money from the game, I'll rent a server and make it a socket server 😶‍🌫️)
